# Technical Report & Presentation Integration Guide

This guide describes how to integrate the project’s **technical report** and **presentation**
into this repository in a clean, portfolio-friendly way.

## Technical report

### Option A (recommended): Markdown

1. Export your report as **Markdown** and save it to `docs/TECHNICAL_REPORT.md`
2. Verify formatting (tables, formulas, references)
3. Ensure `README.md` links to the report (it already does by default)

### Option B: PDF

1. Export as PDF and save as `docs/TECHNICAL_REPORT.pdf`
2. Add/update a link in `README.md`

## Presentation

1. Export your slides as PDF
2. Save to `docs/presentation/ASL_AI_Presentation.pdf`
3. Ensure the README links to it (it already does by default)

## Consistency checklist

- Accuracy numbers are consistent across README/report/presentation
- Model file name is consistent (`models/model.h5` by default)
- Python version compatibility is consistent (Python 3.10–3.11)
