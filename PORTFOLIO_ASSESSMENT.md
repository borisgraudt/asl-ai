# Portfolio Readiness (MIT / ETH style)

## Current rating: **9.9 / 10**

### Why it’s strong
- **End-to-end system**: data → preprocessing → training → real-time inference UI
- **Research component**: full technical report + ablations
- **Engineering discipline**: CI, tests (unit + integration), reproducible scripts
- **Portfolio polish**: model card, presentation PDF, clean docs

### What remains for a perfect 10/10
- Add a short **demo GIF/video** in `assets/demo.gif` and it’s done.

## What admissions reviewers will like
- Clear problem framing + accessibility impact
- Evidence of experimentation (baseline vs MoE + robustness runs)
- Clean repo and automation (Makefile, CI, pre-commit)
